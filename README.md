# Bluesky API Utilities

## Getting started:

First, download the code then options are:

- From the command line, create a virtualenv and install the items listed in requirements.txt.
- Set up a local .env file, and specify your Bluesky handle and the API key.

## General instructions:

Run the create_post function in the file of the same name to create a new post. Change the text
to whatever text you want to post. You can either use the default date (current date) or specify
a date in the past. Note that any future-dated posts are automatically set to the current date.

In this initial version, only simple text-based posts are supported. Images, replies, or reposts
are not yet enabled.
